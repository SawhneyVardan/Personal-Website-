excerpt: "Recently, I have been presented with the opportunity to express my opinions in a rather modern, and mainstream fashion: a blog, more and more blogs pop up daily, however vary in content, designs and opinions. This specific blog focuses on the development of my professional career in the medical field and my intellectual approaches to mathematical concepts, and perspectives on certain issues that have been at the forefront of many minds."

### The rare informing the common, and the case for data

Ever since I started looking at SIR models as part of my math course, diseases have fascinated me. There are a number of small and large diseases that affect varying population sizes, the ones that tend to be the most fascinating are those that are 1/100 000 in incidence. These patients experience life in a very new and profound way. These are the kinds of diseases that patients take from physician to physician without any answers, in a manner that seems absurd, and only adds to the suffering. For this reason, I have found myself divulging deeper into these disorders, as to try to help alleviate the associated pain. However, at the same time, the very fact that they are rare presents a problem in the amount data recorded.

Now,  I have found myself as a keen researcher (looking for internships) thinking more and more about the genetics and cancer, in the back of my mind, I think about these rare diseases and what understanding they may for allow for in common conditions if we knew more about them. For instance, with respect to cancer genetics, we have been provided clues about what genes are essential to particular cancer types, because of familial clusters of cancer. Genes as BRCA1 and BRCA2 in breast and ovarian cancers, or MLH1 in Lynch Syndrome, implicated in colorectal, endometrial and ovarian cancers among others have taught us what can happen when the genes for DNA repair enzymes have a mutation within, and how they might prompt microsatellite instability in the genome of a cell or other phenomena.

But, It is more than genetics mutations. There are many other levels of control of gene expression; for example,e methylation, where abberant inheritance leads to imprinting disorders such as Prader-Willi syndrome and Angelman Syndrome. These have taught us about the critical importance of methylation, and how silencing a relatively small part of the genome can have huge implications.

These small discoveries, from my perspective are synonymous to the tip of a very large iceberg. There are still multiple syndromes of which have no known aetiology. Next generation sequencing technology holds promise in generating and dealing with large amounts of data for these rare diseases, and I truly hope that the clinical application of such might aid us in facing some of the greatest challenges we have currently; as intellectual disabilities, or other neurodevelopment disorders.

There are multiple different facets where the disorders stem from at any level of genetic regulation, ranging from DNA sequence mutations to transcription to transportation, to degradation, to translation to localization. It even possible that these disorders arise due to issues in the non-coding regions of the genome, the parts of DNA that don’t directly code for proteins, but make RNA-based machinery within a cell), perhaps mediated by long non-coding RNA, ribosomal RNA, microRNA, or even the mysterious circular RNA. Time will tell.

Learning about these disorders answers two key questions. First, and foremost, it give an answer to the cause of a disorder that a patient is experiencing. Secondly, it gives us a clue relating genotype to phenotype; it gives us a hint as to what happens when one aspect of a very large network is perturbed, often in very small ways. Learning about progeria might give us important clues about aging; just as learning about Down syndrome has given us important clues about acute leukaemia and Alzheimer’s disease.

Humbly, my hope for this information is that we may use these clues, and infer more and more about what is happening in common disease processes. This is the sort of inference that requires an accessible database of numbers, and therefore cooperation to accomplish, across a number of medical specialties and institutions, and most of all from researchers, practitioners, and patients.

Let’s do this, together.
